## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**

- In this module, I'm introduced to the TypeScript language, learn why it was created, and how to use it for JavaScript development. I also customized the TypeScript development environment for future exercises.

2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**

- In this module, I learned about the benefits of declaring typed variables in TypeScript, learned how to declare variables using primitive and object types, and how to use union and intersection types

3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**

- In this module, I learned the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript, learned how to declare, extend, and instantiate an interface, and how to declare an interface with custom array types

4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**

- In this module, I learned about the benefits of using types in functions, learned about mandatory/non-mandatory, standard and other parameters, and learned how to define function types using type aliases or interfaces

5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**

- In this module, I learned how to use classes to describe the shape of objects, how to commit and instantiate classes, how to apply and define access modifiers and static properties in a class, how to declare a class that extends another class, how to declare an interface to provide the shape of a class, and when to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object.

6. **Generics in TypeScript**

- In this module, I learned how to use generics, define and declare a generic function, declare a generic class, and implement generic constraints

7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**

- In this module, I learned how to organize my code using modules and how to import external type libraries

8. **Organize code using TypeScript namespaces**

- In this module, I explored the purpose of namespaces, implemented single-file and multi-file namespaces, and understood how to design the use of names and modules
