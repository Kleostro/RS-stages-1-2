Hi, my name is Max. I'm twenty-one years old and I'm currently studying to become a junior frontend developer. I have a lot of hobbies, but the main ones I'm focused on at the moment are studying programming and psychology, as well as swimming, which I have been doing for over twelve years.

I also enjoy traveling, going to exhibitions, dining in new beautiful and interesting places and always discovering something new.

I also work as an administrator of two large Telegram channels. One has more than a million subscribers, and the other has four hundred thousand. I am one of the speakers and experts in the «Telegramatica» course on Telegram channels.

Additionally, I am engaged in dancing and perform in a nightclub. Before studying in it, I attended Rostov State Transport University and Russian People's Friendship University.

Currently, I am studying at RSSchool and continuing to learn about Telegram channels.

It is very important for me to improve myself in all areas of my life.
At the moment, I am particularly attracted to frontend development because it offers endless possibilities for implementing innovative ideas and creating incredibly interesting projects. It is also highly addictive, and I believe you would agree with me on this.

I intentionally do not make plans and goals because I enjoy living in a constant flow and always adding new and interesting elements to my life.

My favorite project at the moment is Nonograms, where I implemented a puzzle game that encrypts images. I used the HTML, CSS, and JS stack for it. The biggest challenge for me was that I initially had no idea how to solve these puzzles, so I had to learn it. The most significant achievement for me was finally being able to fully apply classes in JS code, understanding their working principles, and completing the project successfully.

I want to thank you for watching this video, and I wish everyone good luck in their learning journey and getting their dream job offer soon.
